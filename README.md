# Swap-your-Stuff
An app that helps you organize your belongings into a list and determine what you would like to swap/sell.

Instructions: you must run 'bundle install' if using this in Learn IDE. You can
then use 'shotgun' in the terminal and open up a local connection. The website
from there should be self-explanatory and you can create a list of your items
that persists in the database that only you can edit! You can also optionally
make your item tradeable, where other users can see your item and your email
address to get in touch with you for a swap or buy/sell!

Your password is secure on the site. However, it is strongly advised that you
user a different password then the one you use for sensitive financial information.
Please note that this app is not monitored and thus the programmer can give
no guarantee as to the accuracy of information other users post.

Additional functionality will be added later to this app.

For those who are curious the pseudocode file goes over the brainstorming the
programmer undertook before writing the code.
